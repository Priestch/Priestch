I'm a self-taught programmer. I had been working on a web application using Python with Angular.js for almost 3 years.
Currently, I focus on frontend especially. 

I prefer Vue to React in my personal projects, I think React still sucks after hooks were introduced.

I'm currently trying to learn Rust using [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) to build some Desktop apps.

Development Experience:
* Frontend: JS, TS, Angular.js, Vue2/3, React.js, Solid.js, Sass/Less
* Basckend: Python, Flask, Tornado, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
* Tooling: Gulp, Webpack, Rollup, Vite
* Others: Web Worker, WebAssembly, PDF.js, ProseMirror, Strapi, Gatsby, Electron
